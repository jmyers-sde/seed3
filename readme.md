This is my third seed project. It is a sight where you can review books and add your own books and reviews to the website.

To get started just npm install then npm start.

This has both front-end and back-end on this sight and I manipulate the state and use props in the front while going to the database as little as possible.

You may even delete the individual review or the book using the X button on the individual review or remove the book by the remove book button

This project was built with the MERN stack as a full stack project.
